    <p class="a" id='b' >You can use spreadsheet packages to create analytical graphics, or charts. Analytical graphics, or business graphics, are graphical forms that make numeric data easier to analyze than it is when organized as rows and columns of numbers. Whether viewed on a monitor or printed out, analytical graphics help make sales figures, economic trends, and the like easier to comprehend and visualize. In Exel, you enter your data to the work-sheet, select the dat, and use the chart-formatting tools to step through the process of choosing the chart type and various options.Examples of analytical graphics are column charts, bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, and scatter charts.If you have a color printer, these charts can be displayed or printed out so that they look three-dimensional.Most spreadsheet applications are multi-dimesional, meaning that you can link one spreadsheet file to another. A three-dimensional spreadsheet model is like a stack of worksheets all connected by formulas. A change made in one worksheet automatically affects the others. Looking at data in several dimensions could include, for example, sales by region, sales by sales representative, sales by product category, sales by month, and so on. A spreadsheet program's multidimensional view might take on a 3-D graphics form. </p>
